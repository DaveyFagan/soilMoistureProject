# Automated Plant Watering System
#### Student Name: David Fagan  Student ID: 20095398

For my project I am thinking of creating an automated plant watering system. A sensor will measure the soil moisture and when the moisture reaches a certain level water will be pumped into the soil. I would like if a message is sent to the user when the moisture reaches a certain level, allowing the user to water the plant manually if they are home or if they are out the system will water the plant. I would also like a message to be sent to the user when the water source is empty/low. I am hoping to incorporate the camera as well to maybe take pictures/video of the plant each day to a website, or user the video for motion detection for slugs/insects to warn the user. It will also record room temperature and humidity.
